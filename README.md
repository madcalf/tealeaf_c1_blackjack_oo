This will look best on a dark background, but should still be readable on most color schemes. Didn't really think about that before handâ€¦

Works on Mac/Unix. (Windows users, your milage will vary!)

You probably won't see the card suits as symbols unless your console app can display unicode characters. Instead you'll just see the letters representing the suits. Some folks have reported that the app breaks with encoding errors.

Thanks to everyone who's tested it out.
